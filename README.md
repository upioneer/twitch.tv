# twitch.tv

This repository will serve as a collection of various scripts and projects that I'm working on. Each project will have a dedicated directory and documentation.

## Projects

### [Twitch Stream Auto Switcher](auto-switcher)

This project contains a Python script designed to automate the process of finding and playing random streams from a specific Twitch collection. It's built using Playwright for robust browser automation on Linux.

### More to Come

I plan to expand this repository with additional scripts and projects. Stick around for updates.
